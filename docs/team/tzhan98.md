### Project: HackNet

HackNet helps computing students find teammates to do projects with. It allows users to add and find contacts by technical skills, providing them a platform to find the right teammates for each project.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Skill feature
  * _What it does_: Stores a skill name together with a proficiency value which indicates how competent the individual is with the particular skill.
  * _Justification_: This feature is one of the unique selling point of HackNet and most of the other functions build on top of this feature. It allows the user to keep track of the expertise of individuals.
  * _Highlights_: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
